- 👋 Hi, I’m @KostasD97 aka Konstantinos Rafail Detorakis
- 👀 I’m interested in web-dev, hci, java etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning hci theorem + other programming languages because I still am a Postgraduate student at UoC, department of Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web-dev (front end or back end), hci and in general whatever it has design to it :D !!!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
